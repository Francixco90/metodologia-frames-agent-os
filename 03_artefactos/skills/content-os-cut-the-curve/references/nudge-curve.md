# Nudge Curve (in-scene group slide — not a seam)

Slow-fast-slow repositioning of a composed group (word rows, card stacks, lists) to reveal
content or make room. No single built-in ease produces it — `power4.inOut` smacks to a
stop. Chain three tweens on one property:

| Phase     | Ease            | Distance | Time | Feel                                     |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1 ramp-in | `power3.in`     | ~10%     | ~20% | barely moves — motion registers, no jolt |
| 2 burst   | `none` (linear) | ~65%     | ~18% | ~2× average px/frame — purposeful        |
| 3 tail    | `power4.out`    | ~25%     | ~62% | decaying creep to rest — kills the smack |

Rules:

- The tail is ≥3× the ramp-in in TIME. If it still smacks: extend the tail's time (not
  distance) or use `power5.out`.
- Phase 2 stays linear — easing it loses the burst contrast.
- Reveal new content DURING phase 2 — the burst masks its appearance.
- Same ratios vertical; scale distances proportionally, keep the time ratios.
